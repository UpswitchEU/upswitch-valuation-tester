## üìù Code Examples

### Example 1: Using Enhanced API Endpoint
```typescript
// Frontend call
const result = await valuationAPI.calculateWithOwnership({
  company_name: 'Acme GmbH',
  industry: 'technology',
  country_code: 'DE',
  business_type: 'company',
  shares_for_sale: 50,
  current_year_data: {
    year: 2025,
    revenue: 1500000,
    ebitda: 320000
  },
  historical_data: [
    { year: 2023, revenue: 1000000, ebitda: 200000 },
    { year: 2024, revenue: 1200000, ebitda: 250000 }
  ]
});

// Response
{
  equity_value_mid: 2800000,  // 50% of enterprise value
  ownership_adjustment: {
    business_type: 'company',
    shares_for_sale: 50,
    enterprise_value_mid: 5600000,  // Full business value
