# Changelog - Upswitch Valuation Tester

## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-06

### 🐛 Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Form Submission Errors** - Fixed validation and null pointer issues
  - Made Company Name field required (was optional, causing validation errors)
  - Added default company name value to prevent empty string validation errors
  - Improved validation to check for whitespace-only strings
  - Added null safety to Results component (fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null`)
  - All `.toFixed()` calls now use optional chaining with 'N/A' fallback
  - Fixed data quality calculation to properly account for company name

- **Duplicate Business Model Field** - Removed duplicate field in manual input form
  - Business Model field was appearing twice in Basic Information section
  - Kept single required field in logical position (after Industry)
  - Improved form clarity and user experience
  
- **TypeScript Build Errors** - Fixed type checking errors in data quality calculation
  - Corrected property access for `net_income`, `total_assets`, `total_debt`, `cash` to use `current_year_data` object
  - Added optional chaining for `historical_years_data` to prevent undefined errors
  - Production build now compiles successfully (6.17s, 111.57 kB gzipped)

### ✨ Added
- **Data Quality Feedback System** - Real-time data completeness indicator with color-coded progress bar
  - Calculates quality score based on 3 categories: basic fields (40%), current year financials (30%), historical data (30%)
  - Shows contextual tips to improve accuracy
  - Color-coded: Green (80%+), Blue (60-79%), Yellow (40-59%), Red (<40%)
  - Dynamic messages guide users to add missing data

- **Enhanced Tab Navigation** - Clear visual hierarchy with badges
  - "Recommended" badge on Belgian Registry tab
  - "Beta" badge on Document Upload tab

### 🗑️ Removed

  - These buttons had no functionality
  - Created false expectations about calculation time
  - Implied "tiers" that don't exist in backend
  - Backend always does same full calculation

### 🔄 Changed
