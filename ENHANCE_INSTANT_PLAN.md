# üöÄ Plan: Enhance /instant to Match /manual Quality

**Goal:** Achieve same data quality as /manual while keeping conversational UX  
**Target:** 85-95% confidence, ¬±15-20% accuracy, real historical data

---

## üìä **DATA SOURCES**

### **1. From KBO Database (Already Available)**
```typescript
companyData = {
  company_name: "BTW-eenheid GROEP COLRUYT",
  registration_number: "0400378485",
  legal_form: "NV",  // ‚Üê Can help determine business type
  country_code: "BE",
  primary_activity_code: "47.11",
  primary_activity_description: "Retail sale in non-specialised stores",  // ‚Üê KEY for AI
  founding_date: "1965-03-15",  // ‚Üê Get founding year!
  address: "...",
  status: "active"
}
```

**What we can extract:**
- ‚úÖ Company name (have it)
- ‚úÖ Country code (have it)
- ‚úÖ Founding year (from founding_date)
- ‚úÖ Legal form (NV, BVBA, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Industry hint (primary_activity_description)

---

### **2. From AI Inference (Backend)**

**Create new endpoint:** `POST /api/valuation/infer-context`

```python
# Backend: src/api/routes/valuation_inference.py

@router.post("/infer-context")
async def infer_business_context(request: InferContextRequest):
    """
    Use AI to infer industry and business model from company data.
    
    Input:
    - company_name
    - primary_activity_description
    - legal_form
    - country_code
    
    Output:
    - industry: IndustryCode (technology, retail, services, etc.)
    - business_model: BusinessModel (b2b_saas, marketplace, etc.)
    - confidence: 0-1
    - reasoning: Why these were chosen
    """
    
    prompt = f"""
    Based on this company information, determine the industry and business model:
    
    Company: {request.company_name}
    Activity: {request.primary_activity_description}
    Legal Form: {request.legal_form}
    Country: {request.country_code}
    
    Choose from these industries:
    - technology (software, IT services, SaaS)
    - manufacturing (production, assembly)
    - retail (stores, e-commerce)
    - services (consulting, professional services)
    - healthcare (medical, pharma)
    - finance (banking, insurance, fintech)
    - real_estate (property, construction)
    - hospitality (hotels, restaurants)
    - construction
    - other
    
    Choose from these business models:
    - b2b_saas (software as a service, B2B)
    - b2c (direct to consumer)
    - marketplace (platform connecting buyers/sellers)
    - ecommerce (online retail)
    - manufacturing (producing goods)
    - services (consulting, professional services)
    - other
    
    Return JSON:
    {
      "industry": "...",
      "business_model": "...",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Based on 'Retail sale in non-specialised stores', this is clearly a retail company..."
    }
    """
    
    response = await openai_client.complete(prompt)
    return parse_json(response)
```

**What we get:**
- ‚úÖ Industry (correct, not guessed!)
- ‚úÖ Business model (inferred from activity)
- ‚úÖ Confidence in the inference

```

#### **Historical Data (2-3 years)**
```typescript
