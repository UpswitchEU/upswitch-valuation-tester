# ✅ Welcome Message Updated

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Welcome message was inaccurate about timing and user flow

---

## 🔄 **WHAT CHANGED**

### **OLD MESSAGE (Inaccurate):**
```
👋 Welcome! I'll help you value your business in under 30 seconds.

Just tell me your company name and I'll take care of the rest.

How it works:
1. You tell me your company name
2. I find and analyze your financial data
3. You get a professional valuation report

Examples:
• "Innovate NV"
• "Acme Trading"
• "Tech Solutions"

Currently supporting Belgian companies. More countries coming soon! 🚀
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ "Under 30 seconds" - Misleading (actual: 1-2 minutes)
- ❌ Doesn't mention financial questions
- ❌ Oversimplified 3-step flow

---

### **NEW MESSAGE (Accurate):**
```
👋 Welcome! I'll guide you through a quick business valuation.

Just tell me your company name to get started.

How it works:
1. You tell me your company name
2. I search for financial data from official registries
3. If needed, I'll ask you a few quick questions about your financials
4. You review the data and get your professional valuation report

Examples:
• "Proximus"
• "Delhaize"
• "Acme Trading NV"

Time: 1-2 minutes • Privacy: Your data stays secure 🔒

Currently supporting Belgian companies. More countries coming soon! 🚀
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Realistic timing: "1-2 minutes" (not 30 seconds)
- ✅ Mentions financial questions (step 3)
- ✅ 4-step flow reflects actual UX
- ✅ Better examples (real Belgian companies)
- ✅ Privacy notice added (🔒)
- ✅ Sets proper expectations

## 📝 **NOTES**

### **Why "1-2 minutes" not "30 seconds"?**

The original "30 seconds" claim was only true if:
1. Company data exists in APIs (rare)
2. User doesn't read anything
3. No errors occur

In reality:
- Most companies need manual financial input (6 questions)
- Users read the AI messages (~5-10 seconds each)
- Data review takes time (~10-15 seconds)
- First-time users need onboarding

**Honest timing = Better UX = Higher completion rates**

### **Additional State Management Note:**

The `companyInfo` state in `ConversationalFinancialInput.tsx` is now consistently commented out (both declaration and setter) since it's not used in the UI. This is correct - we only need the company ID for the conversation flow.

**Status:** ✅ **Complete and accurate**  
**Impact:** 🟢 **Positive** - Better user expectations
