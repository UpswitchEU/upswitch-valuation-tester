## 🔍 How to Verify Real Data is Used

### 1. Check Backend Logs
When you submit a valuation, you should see:

```bash
INFO: Valuation request received company=Belgian Chocolatier
INFO: Fetching GDP growth for BE from OECD
INFO: OECD API response: {"value": 0.015}
INFO: Fetching inflation for BE from OECD
INFO: OECD API response: {"value": 0.023}
INFO: Fetching risk-free rate for EUR from ECB
INFO: ECB API response: {"value": 0.025}
INFO: DCF engine started
INFO:   WACC calculated: 9.5%
INFO:   Terminal growth: 1.5% (from Belgium GDP)
INFO:   Terminal value: €1,450,000
INFO: Market multiples engine started
INFO:   Size discount: -25%
INFO:   Liquidity discount: -30%
INFO:   Country adjustment: 0% (Belgium stable)
INFO: Valuation synthesis complete
INFO:   DCF weight: 60%
INFO:   Multiples weight: 40%
INFO:   Final value: €850,000
```

### 2. Check Frontend Display
The HTML report should show:

**In DCF Section:**
- ✅ WACC: 9.5% (matches backend log)
- ✅ Terminal Growth: 1.5% (matches Belgium GDP from OECD)
- ✅ Terminal Value: €1,450,000 (matches calculation)

**In Multiples Section:**
- ✅ Size Discount: -25% (matches backend)
- ✅ Liquidity Discount: -30% (matches backend)
- ✅ Country Adjustment: 0% (matches Belgium risk)

### 3. Verify Market Data
**Terminal Growth = Belgium GDP Growth**

If terminal growth shows 1.5%, this came from:
```
OECD API → Belgium GDP Growth → Terminal Growth Rate
```

**WACC includes ECB rates**

If WACC is 9.5%, this used:
```
ECB API → Euro Risk-Free Rate → Cost of Equity → WACC
```
