## Current Limitations

### 1. Range Calculator (Minor Impact)

**Status**: Basic Implementation  
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Minor - users understand range calculation

**Current State**:
The range calculation logic is implemented in the orchestrator using standard confidence-based spreads and asymmetric adjustments. While functional and academically sound, it lacks the detailed step-by-step transparency found in DCF and Multiples methodologies.

**What's Missing**:
- Detailed calculation steps for range spreads
- Confidence tier thresholds explanation
- Asymmetric adjustment rationale
- Industry-specific spread variations

**Example of Current Output**:
```json
{
  "range_methodology": {
    "mid_point": 500000,
    "confidence_level": "HIGH",
    "base_spread": 0.18,
    "low_value": 410000,
    "high_value": 590000
  }
}
```

**Desired Future Output**:
```json
{
  "range_methodology": {
    "mid_point": 500000,
    "confidence_level": "HIGH",
    "base_spread": 0.18,
    "low_value": 410000,
    "high_value": 590000,
    "calculation_steps": [
      "1. Confidence score 80% → HIGH tier (≥80%)",
      "2. HIGH tier base spread: 18%",
      "3. SME asymmetric adjustment: 1.2x downside, 0.8x upside",
      "4. Low = 500,000 × (1 - 0.18 × 1.2) = 410,000",
      "5. High = 500,000 × (1 + 0.18 × 0.8) = 590,000"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Enhancement Plan**:
- Create `RangeCalculator` class
- Add step-by-step tracking
- Document confidence tiers
- Implement in Phase 2 (Q1 2026)

**Workaround**:
Users can infer the logic from the `academic_source` field which references Damodaran (2012), Chapter 14.

### 2. Historical Data Analysis (Low Impact)

**Status**: Partially Exposed  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Low - growth rates are shown

**Current State**:
Historical financial data is used to calculate growth rates and trends, but the detailed analysis steps (regression, smoothing, outlier detection) are not exposed in transparency data.

**What's Missing**:
- Growth rate calculation methodology
- Trend analysis steps
- Seasonality adjustments
- Outlier detection and handling
- Data smoothing techniques

**Example of Current Output**:
```json
{
  "inputs": {
    "revenue_growth": 0.15
  }
}
```

**Desired Future Output**:
```json
{
  "calculation_steps": [
    {
      "description": "Revenue Growth Rate Calculation",
      "formula": "CAGR = ((Revenue_2024 / Revenue_2022)^(1/2)) - 1",
      "inputs": {
        "revenue_2022": 800000,
        "revenue_2024": 1000000,
        "years": 2
      },
      "outputs": {
        "cagr": 0.1180,
        "smoothed_growth": 0.15
      },
      "explanation": "Calculated compound annual growth rate with outlier smoothing applied"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Enhancement Plan**:
- Create `HistoricalAnalyzer` class
- Track growth calculations
- Document smoothing methods
- Implement in Phase 2 (Q1 2026)

**Workaround**:
Growth rates are shown in inputs/outputs, allowing users to verify the final values used.

### 3. Comparable Company Matching (Medium Impact)

**Status**: Not Transparent  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Medium - users may question comparables

**Current State**:
The system shows which comparable companies were used and their similarity scores, but does not explain how similarity is calculated or why certain companies were included/excluded.

**What's Missing**:
- Matching algorithm details
- Similarity score calculation
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Industry classification logic
- Geographic weighting
- Size-based filtering

**Example of Current Output**:
```json
{
  "comparable_companies": [
    {
      "name": "Belgian Coffee Chain",
      "similarity_score": 87,
      "source": "KBO Database"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Desired Future Output**:
```json
{
  "comparable_companies": [
    {
      "name": "Belgian Coffee Chain",
      "similarity_score": 87,
      "source": "KBO Database",
      "matching_details": {
        "industry_match": 100,
        "size_match": 85,
        "geography_match": 90,
        "business_model_match": 75,
        "overall_score": 87,
        "explanation": "High match: same industry (100), similar size (85), same country (90)"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Enhancement Plan**:
- Document matching algorithm
- Add matching_details to ComparableCompany
- Track filtering decisions
- Implement in Phase 2 (Q1 2026)

**Workaround**:
Similarity scores provide a general indication of match quality. Users can review the list of comparables to validate appropriateness.

### 4. Market Data Freshness (Minor Impact)

**Status**: Timestamps Provided  
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Low - timestamps allow verification

**Current State**:
Data sources include timestamps, but there's no explicit freshness validation or stale data warnings in the transparency object.

**What's Missing**:
- Data age warnings
- Stale data detection
- Refresh recommendations
- Historical vs. real-time indicators

**Example of Current Output**:
```json
{
  "data_sources": [
    {
      "name": "Risk-Free Rate",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Desired Future Output**:
```json
{
  "data_sources": [
    {
      "name": "Risk-Free Rate",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-15T10:00:00Z",
      "age_days": 12,
      "freshness": "STALE",
      "warning": "Data is 12 days old. Recommend refresh for critical valuations."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Enhancement Plan**:
- Add freshness validation
- Implement age warnings
- Set freshness thresholds per data type
- Implement in Phase 2 (Q1 2026)

**Workaround**:
Users can check timestamps and calculate data age manually.

### 5. Sensitivity Analysis (Not Implemented)

**Status**: Not Available  
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Low - core valuation is transparent

**Current State**:
The transparency system shows the base valuation but does not expose sensitivity analysis (how valuation changes with different assumptions).

**What's Not Available**:
- WACC sensitivity table
- Growth rate sensitivity
- Multiple sensitivity
- Scenario analysis
- Monte Carlo results

**Desired Future State**:
```json
{
  "sensitivity_analysis": {
    "wacc": {
      "base": 0.10,
      "ranges": [
        {"wacc": 0.08, "equity_value": 620000},
        {"wacc": 0.10, "equity_value": 500000},
        {"wacc": 0.12, "equity_value": 420000}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Enhancement Plan**:
- Implement sensitivity module
- Add to transparency data
- Implement in Phase 3 (Q2 2026)

**Workaround**:
Users can run multiple valuations with different assumptions to create their own sensitivity analysis.

---

### 6. Real-Time Updates (Not Implemented)

**Status**: Snapshot Only  
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Low - valuations are typically point-in-time

**Current State**:
Transparency data is generated once per valuation request. There's no real-time streaming or progressive transparency during long-running calculations.

**What's Not Available**:
- WebSocket transparency updates
- Progressive calculation display
- Live step completion status
- Real-time error notifications

**Desired Future State**:
- WebSocket connection for live updates
- Frontend receives each calculation step as it completes
- Users see progress in real-time

**Enhancement Plan**:
- Implement WebSocket support
- Add progressive transparency
- Implement in Phase 2 (Q1 2026)

**Workaround**:
Current synchronous API works well for typical valuation times (< 5 seconds).

---

## Technical Limitations

### 1. Thread Safety Overhead

**Current Implementation**:
All transparency operations use `threading.Lock` for thread safety, adding minimal overhead (~0.1ms per operation).

**Limitation**:
In highly concurrent scenarios (> 100 simultaneous valuations), lock contention could increase latency.

**Mitigation**:
- Locks are held for minimal time
- Most operations are < 1ms
- Overhead is negligible in practice

**Future Enhancement**:
Consider lock-free data structures if contention becomes an issue.

---

### 2. Memory Usage

**Current Implementation**:
Each valuation with transparency uses 10-50KB of additional memory for transparency data.

**Limitation**:
In memory-constrained environments, transparency could impact capacity.

**Mitigation**:
- Memory usage is proportional to calculation complexity
- Garbage collection handles cleanup efficiently
- Can disable transparency if needed

**Future Enhancement**:
Implement optional transparency (query parameter) to reduce memory usage when not needed.

---

### 3. API Response Size

**Current Implementation**:
Transparency adds 50-100KB to API response size.

**Limitation**:
Larger responses increase network transfer time and bandwidth usage.

**Mitigation**:
- gzip compression reduces size by 70-80%
- Additional 50-100KB is acceptable for most networks
- Frontend can request transparency optionally

**Future Enhancement**:
- Implement compression
- Add `?transparency=false` query parameter
- Paginate calculation steps for very large responses

---

## Non-Limitations (Clarifications)

### 1. Academic Sources

**Clarification**: All formulas cite academic sources. This is not a limitation but a feature ensuring credibility.

### 2. Proprietary Algorithms

**Clarification**: The transparency system exposes calculation formulas but not proprietary matching algorithms or ML models. This is intentional to protect IP.

### 3. User-Specific Data

**Clarification**: Transparency includes user input data (revenue, EBITDA) as this is necessary for calculation validation. This is expected and documented.
